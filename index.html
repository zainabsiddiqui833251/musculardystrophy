                <p>Mitochondria are membrane-bound cell organelles (mitochondrion, singular) that generate most of the
                    chemical energy needed to power the cell's biochemical reactions. Chemical energy produced by the
                    mitochondria is stored in a small molecule called adenosine triphosphate (ATP).</p>
                <br>
                <h5>functions of mitochondria:</h5>
                <p>The functions of mitochondria obviously include oxidative phosphorylation to produce cellular ATP,
                    but
                    they also have important roles in ion homeostasis, in several metabolic pathways, in apoptosis and
                    programmed cell death, and in ROS production and consumption. </p>

                <h6>Muscular dystrophy is a group of disorders that affect the voluntary muscles in the human body.
                    People experience progressive weakening of skeletal muscle and loss of muscle mass suffering from
                    this disease. The disease is caused due to the interference of abnormal genes in the formation of
                    proteins required for muscle formation. In muscular dystrophy, abnormal genes (mutations) interfere
                    with the production of proteins needed to form healthy muscle.

                    <br>
                    There are many kinds of muscular dystrophy. Symptoms of the most common variety begin in childhood,
                    mostly in boys. Other types don't surface until adulthood.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    There's no cure for muscular dystrophy. But medications and therapy can help manage symptoms and
                    slow the course of the disease.

        <div class="types" style="width: 90%;" id="types">
            <h1>types of muscular dystrophy</h1>
            <p>As mentioned earlier, it is a group of diseases that affect different parts of the body. The major forms
                of the disease include:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><b>Duchenne muscular dystrophy</b> It is the most common form of the disease affecting 1 out of
                    3,500 male children worldwide. The symptoms of the disease generally occur between the age of 2 and
                    6. The muscles of the arms, legs, and spine are progressively deformed and in most cases, the
                    patient is wheelchair-bound by the age of 12 and die in their late teens or early twenties.
                </li>

                <li><b>Becker muscular dystrophy</b> It is a less severe form of Duchenne which appears between the ages
                    of 2 and 16. The progression of the disease is slow and people with Becker have a higher chance of
                    survival than those with Duchenne.
                </li>

                <li><b>Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy</b> This form of the disease makes it onset in the teenage years.
                    It begins with the weakening of the hips muscles and slowly moves up to arms, legs, and shoulders.
                    People with this disease have difficulty in walking and are often bound to the wheelchair by the age
                    of 20.
                </li>

                <li><b>Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy</b>In this form, the disease affects the muscles of the
                    face, shoulder blades and upper arms. The onset of the disease is generally in the early teenage
                    years. A person suffering from this form of the disease might have trouble in chewing, closing their
                    eyelids and moving their arms.
                </li>

                <li><b>Myotonic muscular dystrophy</b> It is the most common form of muscular dystrophy during
                    adolescence. It is characterized by the inability to move muscles after a contraction. The muscles
                    in the face and the neck are often the first to be affected.
                </li>
                <li><b>Congenital muscular dystrophies (CMD)</b> refers to a group of muscular dystrophies that become
                    apparent at or near birth (“congenital” means “present from birth”). CMD causes overall muscle
                    weakness with possible joint stiffness or looseness. Depending on the type, CMD may also involve
                    spinal curvature (scoliosis), breathing issues, intellectual disabilities, learning disabilities,
                    eye issues or seizures.</li>
                <li><b>Distal muscular dystrophy </b>affects the muscles of your hands, feet, lower arms and lower legs.
                    It tends to affect people in their 40s and 60s.</li>
                <li><b>Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) </b>mainly affects children and young adults AMAB. It
                    tends to cause muscle weakness in your shoulders, upper arms and shins. EDMD also affects your
                    heart. The condition usually progresses slowly.</li>
                <li><b>Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) </b>weakens muscles in your eyelids and throat.
                    Symptoms, such as droopy eyelids (ptosis) and difficulty swallowing (dysphagia), often appear in
                    your 40s or 50s. About 1 in 100,000 people have OPMD.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="signs" id="signs">
            <h1>signs & symptoms</h1>
            <h5>some of the symptoms and signs of muscular dystrophy are the following;</h5>

            <p>Muscle atrophy ,
                Difficulty walking, climbing stairs or running ,
                Irregular walking gait (like waddling or toe walking) ,

            <p>The symptoms of some types of muscular dystrophy are mild and progress slowly over time as you age. Other
                types cause more rapid muscle weakness and physical disability.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="causes" id="causes">
            <h1>causes</h1>
            <h5>some of the causes of muscular dystrophy are the following;</h5>
            <p>The majority of muscular dystrophies are inherited; the different muscular dystrophies follow various
                inheritance patterns (X-linked, autosomal recessive or autosomal dominant). In a small percentage of
                patients, the disorder may have been caused by a de novo (spontaneous) mutation.</p>
            <p>There are three ways you can inherit muscular dystrophy, depending on the specific type:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Recessive inheritance:</b> This means you've inherited a genetic mutation that causes the
                    condition from both of your biological parents. Some forms of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy have
                    this inheritance.</li>
                <li><b>Dominant inheritance:</b>This means you only need to inherit the mutated gene from one of your
                    biological parents to develop the condition. Myotonic, facioscapulohumeral and oculopharyngeal
                    muscular dystrophies have this type of inheritance.</li>
                <li><b>Sex-linked (X-linked) inheritance:</b>A genetically male person has one X and one Y chromosome,
                    and a genetically female person has two X chromosomes. A genetic mutation on the X chromosome causes
                    a sex-linked condition. As genetically male people only have one copy of each gene on the X
                    chromosome, they’ll develop the condition if one of those genes is mutated. A genetically female
                    person can have X-linked disorders, but the symptoms are usually less severe. Duchenne and Becker
                    muscular dystrophies have this type of inheritance.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>In rare cases, a person may develop muscular dystrophy spontaneously, meaning the mutation happened
                randomly and wasn’t inherited. This is called a de novo mutation.</p>

        <div class="pathophysiology" id="pathophysiology">
            <h1>pathophysiology</h1>
            <div class="image">
                <img src="./img/pathophysiology.webp" alt="" width="30%">
            </div>
            <p>Multiple proteins are involved in the complex interactions of the muscle membrane and extracellular
                environment. For sarcolemmal stability, dystrophin and the dystrophin-associated glycoproteins (DAGs)
                are important elements.</p>
            <p>The dystrophin gene is located on the short arm of chromosome X near the p21 locus and codes for the
                large protein Dp427, which contains 3685 amino acids. Dystrophin accounts for only approximately 0.002%
                of the proteins in striated muscle, but it has obvious importance in the maintenance of the muscle's
                membrane integrity.</p>
            <p>Dystrophin aggregates as a homotetramer at the costomeres in skeletal muscles, as well as associates with
                actin at its N-terminus and the DAG complex at the C-terminus, forming a stable complex that interacts
                with laminin in the extracellular matrix. Lack of dystrophin leads to cellular instability at these
                links, with progressive leakage of intracellular components; this results in the high levels of creatine
                phosphokinase (CPK) noted on routine blood workup of patients with Duchenne MD.</p>
            <p>Less active forms of dystrophin may still function as a sarcolemmal anchor, but they may not be as
                effective a gateway regulator because they allow some leakage of intracellular substance. This is the
                classic Becker dystrophy. In both Duchenne and Becker MD, the muscle-cell unit gradually dies, and
                macrophages invade. Although the damage in MD is not reported to be immunologically mediated, class I
                human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) are found on the membrane of dystrophic muscles; this feature makes
                these muscles more susceptible to T-cell mediated attacks.</p>
            <p>Selective monoclonal antibody hybridization was used to identify cytotoxic T cells as the invading
                macrophages; complement-activated membrane attack complexes have been identified in dystrophic muscles
                as well. Over time, the dead muscle shell is replaced by a fibrofatty infiltrate, which clinically
                appears as pseudohypertrophy of the muscle. The lack of functioning muscle units causes weakness and,
                eventually, contractures.</p>
            <p>Other types of MDs are caused by alterations in the coding of one of the DAG complex proteins. The gene
                loci coding for each of the DAG complex proteins is located outside the X chromosomes. Gene defects in
                these protein products also lead to alterations in cellular permeability; however, because of the
                slightly different mechanism of action and because of the locations of these gene products within the
                body, there are other associated effects, such as those in ocular and limb-girdle type dystrophies (see
                the image below).</p>

                <h5>The main goal of treatment is to manage symptoms and improve your quality of life. Treatments can
                    vary depending on the type of muscular dystrophy and may include:</h5>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Corticosteroids:</b>Corticosteroids, such as prednisolone and deflazacort, may be beneficial
                        for delaying muscle weakness, improving lung function, delaying scoliosis, slowing the
                        progression of cardiomyopathy and prolonging survival.</li>
                    <li><b>Mobility aids: </b>Devices such as canes, braces, walkers and wheelchairs can improve your
                        mobility and help prevent falls.</li>
                    <li><b>Physical and occupational therapies:</b>The main goal of these therapies is to strengthen and
                        stretch your muscles. They can help you maintain movement function.</li>
                    <li><b>Surgery:</b> People with muscular dystrophy may need surgery to relieve tension on contracted
                        muscles and to correct spine curvature (scoliosis).
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Heart care:</b>Early treatment with ACE inhibitors and/or beta-blockers may slow the
                        progression of cardiomyopathy and prevent the onset of heart failure. Pacemakers can also help
                        treat heart rhythm problems and heart failure.</li>
                    <li><b>Speech therapy: </b>This can help people who have difficulty swallowing</li>
                    <li><b>Respiratory care:</b>Cough-assist devices and respirators can help with breathing.
                        Tracheostomy and assisted ventilation may be necessary in cases of respiratory failure.</li>
                    <li><b>medicines:</b>Medications have also been recently developed that may alter the course of
                        certain forms of the disease. Examples include eteplirsen and golodirsen for DMD (Duchenne
                        muscular dystrophy).</li>

                        <li>Eat a healthy diet to prevent malnutrition.
                        </li>
                        <li>Drink lots of water to avoid dehydration and constipation.
                        </li>
                        <li>Exercise as much as possible according to your healthcare team's recommendations.
                        </li>
                        <li>Maintain a healthy weight.

                    <h5>What is the prognosis for muscular dystrophy?
                    </h5>
                    <p>The prognosis (outlook) for muscular dystrophy varies depending on the type. Your healthcare
                        provider will be able to give you a better idea of what to expect based on the type of muscular
                        dystrophy you have and your unique situation.

                    </h5>
                    <p>The life expectancy for muscular dystrophy varies significantly depending on the type.

                    </p>
                    <p>For example, people with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) often die from the condition by the
                        age of 25. But other forms of muscular dystrophy, such as oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy,
                        don’t typically affect life expectancy.
